    <main id="poem">
      <p>I once felt at home in this room<br>
        With its pink walls, twin beds, and twinkling lights.<br>
        Where we danced and laughed.<br>
        Where our feet sank into the tan rug.<br>
        Where the sweet scent of her laundry whirled around our bodies.<br>
        Where Aunt Sharon entered to bestow upon us<br>
        Forehead kisses and bedtime prayers.<br>
        Where we gently asked the Lord to spare our budding souls.</p>
      <p>I now feel at odds with this room,<br>
        Where gray walls absorb sobs of grief.<br>
        Where I sit with her, our eyes red, lungs full of smoke.<br>
        Where I move my head through viscous air and examine the lifeless walls, single bed, clashing<br>
        accents of canary yellow.<br>
        Where posters urge her to “be happy.”<br>
        Where memories are diminished to polaroids pinned to a corkboard.<br>
        Where walls that could once barely contain our laughter, now muffle her cries.<br>
        Maybe it’s the smoke, or the sadness,<br>
        but something hangs heavy between us.</p>
