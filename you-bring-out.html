      <h1>You Bring Out the Florida in Me</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p>You bring out the child in me.<br>
        You bring out bubblegum pink, puckered coats of paint. The popstar in me. Katy Perry candy corset in me. Electric pink talons and aqua-lined lids.<br>
        You bring out the Annaleigh in me. The coily-haired girl with coffee mug eyes. My first sip of bittersweet friendship. <br>
        You bring out the gator in me. Callousness covered by turbid swamps.<br>
        You bring out the mystic. Mermaid-tail, winged, hooved goddess in me. Consumer of spirits, symbols, sorcery. <br>
        You bring out the Julia in me. Bushy brows hidden behind a shiny shield of black. Ally in the first strides of literacy. Co-traveler trampling across picture book pages. <br>
        You bring out the heiress in me. Princess of the tan Toyota. Lazing on a pink throne. Commanding my subjects, “turn up the music.”<br>
        You bring out the dread in me. Silently slithering through the stems of my conscience. <br>
        You bring out my wishes as frail as dragonfly wings. Pinned in the scrapbook of memory. <br>
        You bring out the clubhouse brat in me. Plaid skirt, collared shirt in me. <br>
        You bring out the southern Methodist sect in me. The “praise be” in me. The back pew heart attack in me.<br>
        You bring out the hope in me. Fingers crush chords of a major key. <br>
